# STK-INF4000 Homework Boilerplate Code and Tests

Code to get students started with STK-INF4000 homework. The repository
contains

- Boilerplate code
- Tests

The idea is that you complete the code to make the tests pass, and
thus completing your homework assignment (or parts of it).

## Week 3 Assignments

You'll find the boilerplate code in the file
[homework.py](week03/homework.py), together with some descriptions.

### Tests

The tests can be found in the file
[week03/tests/test_hw.py](week03/tests/test_hw.py) and can be run from
the directory [week03](week03) using the command

    python -m unittest tests.test_hw

## Week 4 Assignments

The assignments and tests for week 4 are located in the same
[folder](week04) and the tests can be run by calling from the
[week04 directory](week04)

    python tests.py

## Week 5 Assignments

The templates are located in the folder [week4](week4) and the
instructions to execute the tests are identical to last week's.
